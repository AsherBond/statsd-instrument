# Changelog

This file documents the changes between releases of this library. When creating a pull request,
please at an entry to the "unreleased changes" section below.

### Unreleased changes

- **DEPRECATION**: Relying on the return value of the StatsD metric methods (e.g. `StatsD.increment`)
  is deprecated. StatsD is a fire-and-forget protocol, so your code should not depend on the return
  value of these methods.

  The documentation of the methods has been updated to reflect this change. The behavior of the
  library is not changed for the time being, so you can safely upgrade to this version. However,
  in a future major release, we will start to explicitly return `nil`.

  This gem comes with a Rubocop rule that can help verify that your application is not relying
  on the return value of the metric methods. To use this cop on your codebase, invoke Rubocop
  with the following arguments:

  ``` sh
  rubocop --require /absolute/path/to/statsd-instrument/lib/statsd/instrument/rubocop/metric_return_value.rb \
    --only StatsD/MetricReturnValue <file-name-or-pattern>

  ```

- **Performance improvements ðŸŽ‰**: Several internal changes have made the library run singificantly
  faster. The changes:

  - Improve performance of duration calculations. (#168)
  - Early exit when no changes are needed to bring tags and metric names to normalized form. (#173)
  - Refactor method argument handling to reduce object allocations and processing. (#174)

  A benchmark suite was added (#169) and it now runs as part of CI (#170) so we can more easily spot
  performance regressions before they get merged into the library.

  The result:

  ```
  Comparison:
  StatsD metrics to local UDP receiver (branch: master, sha: 2f98046):    10344.9 i/s
  StatsD metrics to local UDP receiver (branch: v2.4.0, sha: 371d22a):     8556.5 i/s - 1.21x  (Â± 0.00) slower
  ```

- _Bugfix:_ avoid deadlock when an error occurs in the integration test suite (#175)

## Version 2.4.0

- Add `StatsD.default_tags` to specify tags that should be included in all metrics. (#159)
- Improve assertion message when asserting metrics whose tags do not match. (#100)
- Enforce the Shopify Ruby style guide. (#164)
- Migrate CI to Github actions. (#158)
- Make the library frozen string literal-compatible. (#161, #163)
- Fix all Ruby warnings. (#162)

## Version 2.3.5

- Re-add `StatsD::Instrument.duration`, which was accidentally removed since verison 2.5.3 (#157)

## Version 2.3.4

- Improve performance of `Metric#to_s` (#152)
- Fix bug in escaping newlines for events with Datadog Backend (#153)

## Version 2.3.3

- Capture measure and distribution metrics on exception and early return (#134)

NOTE: Now that exceptions are measured statistics may behave differently. An exception example:
```
StatsD.measure('myhttpcall') do
  my_http_object.invoke
end
```
Version 2.3.2 and below did not track metrics whenever a HTTP Timeout exception was raised.
2.3.3 and above will include those metrics which may increase the values included.

A return example:
```
StatsD.measure('myexpensivecalculation') do
  return if expensive_calculation_disabled?
  expensive_calculation
end
```
If `expensive_calculation_disabled?` is true 50% of the time version 2.3.2 will drop the
average metric considerably.
